HAS_ESP_DRIVERS: Check for esp_driver_* component support

Older esp-idf versions provide a monolithtic `driver` component. This
component includes several headers, such as `driver/gpio.h`. The component was
later succeeded by multiple components, such as `esp_driver_gpio`.

See Migration from 5.2 to 5.3 for more details.

https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v6.0/esp32/migration-guides/release-5.x/5.3/peripherals.html

When `HAS_ESP_DRIVERS` is true, add `esp_driver_*` to REQUIRES or
PRIV_REQUIRES when calling idf_component_register().

When false, add `driver` to REQUIRES or PRIV_REQUIRES.

REQUIRES should be set to all components whose header files are
`#included` from the public header files of this component.

PRIV_REQUIRES should be set to all components whose header files are
`#included` from any source files in this component, unless already listed
in REQUIRES.
